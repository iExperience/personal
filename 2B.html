  On the right,

            The Bru serves as the official generic user for the <a href="http://iexperience.co.za" target="_blank">iExperience</a> code base. This involves a tremendous number of things, including but not limited to:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Keeping up his swagger by doing bruey things.</li>
            <li>Excelling at his other career (see below).</li>
            <li>Charity work.</li>

          <h3>Art and Surfing</h3>
          <p>
            A Renaissance man of the past and future, the Bru makes a living by
            painting...while surfing. He specializes in water color. 
          </p>
          <p>
            On rare occasions, The Bru does a real-time self portrait, as you can see below.

          <h3>Shark Diving</h3>
          <p>
            Commonly known as "Man's worst friend" (after gingivitis), sharks are found by the BILLIONS along Cape Town's otherwise friendly and joyous shores. Those looking for a thrill can make a small cut in their finger, dip it into the ocean, and test who's reflexes are faster, theirs or nature's! 
          </p>
          <p>
            You can see The Bru's friend Brunette in this clearly not-photoshopped image (The Bru, of course, was calm and collected).
