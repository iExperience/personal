            <ul>
              <li>Keeping up his swagger by doing bruey things.</li>
              <li>Excelling at his other career (see below).</li>

            <h3>Art and Surfing</h3>
            <p>
              A Renaissance man of the past and future, the Bru makes a living by
              painting...while surfing. He specializes in water color.
